# Standing Range of Motion Version Log

The main (dev) branch is stable and represents the project's source of truth with fully fleshed out features (nothing hard-coded, mocked, or placed for the sake of demoing).

The dummyDemo (prod) branch is hooked to auto-deploy to Vercel, and represents the current version of the demo link that gets sent out as a demonstration.
